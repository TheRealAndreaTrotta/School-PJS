                        Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci, born on <b>April 15, 1452</b> in the small village of Vinci, Tuscany, is one of the most celebrated polymaths in history. The illegitimate son of Ser Piero da Vinci, a notary, and Caterina, a peasant, his youth was marked by great curiosity and intense thirst for knowledge.
                        <br><br>
                        At the age of 14, Leonardo was sent to Florence to apprentice in the workshop of <b>Andrea del Verrocchio</b>, one of the leading artists of the Renaissance. There, Leonardo developed his artistic skills, learning painting, sculpture, and the art of engineering. During this time, he contributed to famous paintings such as <b>"The Battle of Anghiari"</b> and <b>"The Birth of Venus"</b>.
                        <br><br>
                        In 1482, Leonardo left Florence to move to Milan, where he became a court artist for Ludovico Sforza, the Duke of Milan. During this period, he created some of his most famous masterpieces, including <b>"The Last Supper"</b> and <b>"The Virgin of the Rocks"</b>. He was also active as a military engineer and architect, designing defense systems for the city and working on hydraulic engineering projects.
                        <br><br>
                        After the fall of Milan in <b>1499</b>, Leonardo traveled through Italy, working for various lords and creating a series of paintings and sculptures. In <b>1503</b>, he returned to Florence, where he began painting one of his most famous masterpieces, the <b>"Mona Lisa"</b>, an enigmatic portrait that still fascinates the world today.
                        <br><br>
                        Leonardo continued to travel and work for various Italian rulers, dedicating himself to a wide range of interests, including science, anatomy, astronomy, and hydraulics. He died on <b>May 2, 1519 in Cloux</b>, France, leaving an extraordinary legacy that continues to inspire artists, scientists, and innovators around the world.
