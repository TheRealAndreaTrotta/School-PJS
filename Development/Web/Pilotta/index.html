            Between the late 17th and early 18th centuries, the famous collection of artworks, rare and precious objects, 
            paintings, and coins owned by the Farnese family and transferred from Rome to Parma in the mid-17th century was 
            exhibited in a large hall of the Palazzo della Pilotta. A significant part of the collection was moved to Naples 
            in 1734 by Charles of Bourbon, the last descendant of the Farnese family governing the Emilia city, with the exception 
            of famous paintings such as El Greco's "The Healing of the Blind Man" and Sebastiano del Piombo's "Portrait of Pope Paul 
            III Farnese.
